Internal joke went scripted.

## Long Story Short
This little gig had initially begun as (and still is!) an internal joke between friends. Further details won't follow, but apparently designing this simple `name database` with a RESTful API came in handy for other things and uses in my work so I thought I'd just publish this mostly for our friends to integrate their apps with (to keep our internal joke alive, of course) but also for anyone who'd want to learn or anything. It's released without any license, do whatever you want.

### Notice
The original database has been replaced with a dummy one for a simple reason: You don't want to see it.
