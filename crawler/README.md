# crawler
The crawler (written in `Python`) is a script designated to scan a .txt file contents and convert them (line-by-line) into the shared database stored in the `server` folder.
Additionally (due to legacy reasons), the crawler will be able to access a remote Dropbox folder using their API and perform the conversion process on it.
